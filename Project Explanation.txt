Rast Mobile Frontend Task

Purpose of the project was implementing a website with datagrid and pop-up UI's.
Firstly, wanted website design is partitioned into components such as Button, Input, Row Selector, Pagination, Datagrid, and Sidebar.
All these components are implemented independently and generic way to handle all designs in the given website. 
After that, all of the implemented components are merged into a single page. 
Dynamic mechanisms are built such as search, row sort, new account addition, row count selection, and change page. 
Lastly, saved records are saved into localstorage and responsive design is built.
